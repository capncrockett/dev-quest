# 🧠 Dev Quest – Full Stack Playground

This repo is a personal journey through modern web development and backend engineering using JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, and PostgreSQL. It’s designed to be:

- 💻 **Project-first** – Learn by building
- 🛠️ **Minimal dependency** – Roll your own whenever possible
- 🧠 **AI-augmented** – Guided by an AI agent (Windsurf/Cline/etc.)
- 🔄 **Resettable** – Return to "Back to Basics" with a single command

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Install your preferred AI agent extension in VS Code or use an IDE like Windsurf
3. Load `ai/memory-block.md` into your agent
4. Start with a tiny app or daily challenge!

## Goals

- Build full stack mini apps (frontend + C# backend + Postgres)
- Reinforce core concepts across languages
- Compare how ideas translate between JS/TS, C#, SQL
- Use AI to guide not _answer_ your learning

## Reset

Run `./seed/reset.sh` to wipe all lessons and restart from scratch.

## Agents

See `/agents/` for setup instructions per AI extension.

## AI Agent Setup

This project works best with a coding assistant like **Windsurf**, **Cline**, or **Cursor**. To set up:

### Windsurf

1. Open this project in Windsurf.
2. Go to the **Memories and Rules** panel.
3. Choose **Add workspace rules**.
4. Paste the contents of `ai/memory-block.md` into the .windsurfrules.
5. Done!

### Cline

_(coming soon – see `/agents/cline.md`)_

### Cursor / Others

_(coming soon – see `/agents/`)_

The memory block ensures the AI understands the learning style and project philosophy. Update it as the project evolves.
